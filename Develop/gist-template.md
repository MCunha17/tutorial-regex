# Regex Tutorial: Matching an HTML Tag

This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding how a particular regular expression (regex) works. Regex, short for regular expression, is a powerful tool for manipulating text. It's used to find and replace patterns within strings and validate user input to ensure it meets specific criteria.

## Summary

Our featured regular expression for this tutorial is an HTML tag matcher:

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

This regex checks if a given string is a valid HTML tag. HTML tags are the building blocks of all websites, and making sure they're properly formatted is vital for the web page's correct rendering.
