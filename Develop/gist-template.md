In the realm of Search Advertising, understanding and applying regular expressions (regex) can become an indispensable skill. They allow you to manipulate text and find specific patterns in a string, enabling you to handle and make sense of large sets of data, like the ones you might encounter in a search advertising campaign.

One frequent application in search advertising could be ensuring that all your HTML tags, crucial for SEO and tracking purposes, are correctly formatted. This tutorial will focus on understanding a specific regex used to match HTML tags.
